				<h3>Did or does Savannah go to university?</h3>
				<h4>You betcha! Savannah goes to the University of Waterloo and studies Geomatics within the Faculty of Environment (currently in her fourth and final(!!!) year). But, you might be wondering...what is Geomatics? According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics">Wikipedia</a>, Geomatics is "the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information". This still might not make sense but, Geomatics is actually a widespread discipline that encompasses things like satellite imagery, geographic information systems (GIS), and web mapping. Oh yeah, and she's also working towards a minor in Computer Science.</h4>

				<h3>So...she can code?</h3>
				<h4>Can she ever! Savannah loves to code! She has been learning to program by solving algorithm problems online in both Javascript and Python (<a href = "https://github.com/savannahostrowski/practice-problems">check out the repo!</a>), and creating projects like her personal website, a chart generator, a map of the places she's been and the infamous BrickBreaker clone! While she is mostly self-taught, she has also taken courses at the University of Waterloo (like Computer Science 1 and 2, Data Types and Structures and Management Information Systems). Oh and she's also attended some <a href = "http://ladieslearningcode.com"> Ladies Learning Code</a> workshops on Javascript and jQuery, HTML and CSS and Wordpress with PHP.</h4>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>What languages is she familiar with?</h3>
				<h4>Lots of Javascript/jQuery (aside: she's worked with AngularJS, node.js, D3.js, PhantomJS, Mocha and Chai), a good amount of Python, a whole bunch of HTML5 and CSS3 (also, some SASS), and a small bit of PHP (mainly through Wordpress and Volt). Up next: Ruby on Rails!
			<section>
				<h3>But is she involved in the tech community?</h3>
				<h4> Yep! She recently volunteered at Toronto's FITC (Future. Technology. Innovation. Creativity.) Conference in April 2015 and had a blast (attending talks on Building Strong Code Through Patterns, Fostering Collaboration: Pattern Libraries / Rapid Prototyping, Rapid Prototyping with Front End Frameworks and Whatâ€™s new in ES6 for Web Devs). She also looks forward to participating in any hackathon she can get her hands on in the near future!</h4>

				<h3>Ok, so that's great! But what has else has Geomatics taught her? </h3>
				<h4> Through her time in the Geomatics program, she's learned about version control (in ArcGIS and using Git), spatial analysis (using ArcGIS, ENVI, Geomatica etc.), spatial and non-spatial databases (and SQL), some stuff about math (like Calculus and Linear Algebra), conducting research, communicating technical concepts without losing all the good stuff, synthesizing scientific journals into literature reviews etc. etc. etc.</h4>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Does she have any hobbies?</h3>
				<h4>Yeah, she does. She's really into cooking (not so much baking), hot yoga, hiking, and coding (over 100 day streak!)</h4>
