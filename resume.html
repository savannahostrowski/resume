				<h3>Did or does Savannah go to university?</h3>
				<h4>You betcha! Savannah goes to the University of Waterloo and studies Geomatics within the Faculty of Environment. But, you might be wondering...what is Geomatics? According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics">Wikipedia</a>, Geomatics is "the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information". This still might not make sense but, Geomatics is actually a widespread discipline and encompasses things like satellite imagery, geographic information systems (GIS), and web mapping. Oh yeah, and she also has a minor in Computer Science.</h4>
